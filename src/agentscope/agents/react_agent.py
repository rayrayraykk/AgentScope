1. First, analyze the current situation, and determine your goal.
2. Then, check if your goal is already achieved. If so, try to generate a response. Otherwise, think about how to achieve it with the help of provided tool functions.
3. Respond in the required format.

## Note:
1. Fully understand the tool functions and their arguments before using them.
2. You should decide if you need to use the tool functions, if not then return an empty list in "function" field.
3. Make sure the types and values of the arguments you provided to the tool functions are correct.
4. Don't take things for granted. For example, where you are, what's the time now, etc. You can try to use the tool functions to get information.
5. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.
